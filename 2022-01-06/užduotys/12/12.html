    <h1 class="heading">Best ways to learn Javascript</h1>
    <h2>1.Self-Guided Websites and Courses</h2>
    <p class="par1">
      The Internet is, above all else, a repository of knowledge. Whether you’re
      interested in self-guided learning or just don’t have the time to enroll
      in a formal program, flexible online courses might be the educational
      answer for you. These free and paid online courses show you how to learn
      JavaScript fast, but do keep in mind that “free” doesn’t always equate to
      “better.” Often, free programs will have less direction and offer less
      support than their paid alternatives. Be sure to do your research before
      you take your first class!

    <h2>2.Starting Your Own Project</h2>
    <p class="par2">
        If you don’t put your hard-earned knowledge into practice, what was the
        point of learning it in the first place? At some point, aspiring
        developers need to make the transition from tutorials to real,
        honest-to-goodness programming. But that shift isn’t always smooth.
        <br />
        It can feel overwhelming to move beyond the comfortable bounds of
        step-by-step assignments and build an app from scratch. But if you
        continue to reach for tutorials, you’ll never have the opportunity to
        exercise your creativity or even take your first step into independent
        development. The best way to learn how to code is by programming — but you
        don’t need to launch into a massive project from the get-go to do it.
        <br />
        Start small. When you feel that you’re ready to apply your JavaScript
        skills to a real project, try adding a feature to a program you created in
        a tutorial rather than starting another program from scratch. Or, begin
        within an existing framework and start building Chrome extensions. If you
        need support, try co-constructing a project with a friend.
        <br />
        The hardest step is always that first effort to remove the tutorial
        training wheels. Not sure where to start? Try a few of the projects listed
        below to apply your JavaScript knowledge to a new project!

    <h2>3.Coding Boot Camps</h2>
    <p class="par3">
      Maybe the self-taught route isn’t for you. While you know that you could
      push yourself to learn from an on-demand self-guided course or out of a
      book’s activity chapters, you want a little more support and guidance
      throughout your educational journey, as well as a certificate upon
      completion. <br />If that’s the case, then a coding boot camp might be the
      route for you. In recent years, boot camps have come to the educational
      forefront as a means to gain marketable skills quickly, and without
      spending the time or money that traditional four-year educational programs
      require. The average boot camp tends to run between a few weeks and a few
      months, depending on whether their structure follows a part- or full-time
      schedule.<br />This short-term timeline makes a coding boot camp one of
      the best ways to learn JavaScript fast so you can get right back to work
      (or look for a more attractive position with your newly acquired skills).
      This kind of professional course has seen a popularity boom in recent
      years; according to a 2019 Course Report study, enrollment for virtual
      boot camp programs grew 171 percent between 2018 and 2019, while the
      coding boot camp market as a whole grew by 49 percent over the same
      period.

    <h2>4.Meetups and Networking Events</h2>
    <p class="par4">
      “Networking” probably isn’t the first (or most conventional) answer that
      comes to mind when you start researching the best ways to learn JavaScript
      — but it is among the most useful.
      <br />
      The educational benefits of attending meetups and networking events are
      considerable. If you’re focused on learning JavaScript quickly, going to
      panels on the language will allow you to learn from people who have a
      wealth of experience using it. But the learning doesn’t stop at a
      presentation; it continues in the conversations you have afterward.
      <br />
      “You may think, ‘I don’t need friends. I’m fine.’ Trust me — this sort of
      rapport with like-minded peers is exactly what you need,” business and
      career writer Peter Tourian shared in an article for Forbes. “It feels
      good to help people and it’s crazy how much you end up learning and
      receiving just by doing everything you can to assist others.”
      <br />
      Sometimes, the best way to learn JavaScript isn’t to sit with your nose to
      the grindstone or in a book; it’s to speak with others who are learning,
      exploring, and achieving with you.
