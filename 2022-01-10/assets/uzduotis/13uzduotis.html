        Whether you're interested in pursuing one of the happiest jobs in
        America or one of the fastest-growing career paths, there's a good
        chance it involves computer science. Coveted roles in data science,
        software engineering, and cybersecurity all require a comfortable
        understanding of how computers and computational systems work.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're interested in learning the basics of computer science — and
        from one of the top schools in the world — Harvard University offers its
        CS50 classes and professional certificates through edX, an e-learning
        platform co-founded by Harvard.
      </p>
      <p>
        CS50 classes are beginner computer science courses, with the
        introductory CS50 course being the largest one on Harvard's campus. Its
        popularity is reflected online as well: Since being adapted into a free
        virtual version, nearly three million people have enrolled, making it
        one of the top 100 edX courses of all time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below, you'll find all the free Harvard CS50 courses currently available
        (with the option of a paid certificate of completion for all of them).
        Topics range from game development to web programming with Python and
        Java.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also enroll in a paid CS50 professional certificate program,
        such as the data science program, which compiles multiple related
        courses together to master a skill and provide certification for your
        resume or LinkedIn profile. You can find the full list of those programs
        here, including CS50's AP Computer Science Principles ($358.20), which
        offers high schoolers HarvardX certification as well as AP credit upon
        completion of the AP exam.
